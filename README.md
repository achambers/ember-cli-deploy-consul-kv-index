# ember-cli-deploy-consul-kv-index

> An ember-cli-deploy plugin to upload and manage index.html in a Consul key/value store

This plugin uploads a file, presumably index.html, to a specified Consul KV
store.

More often than not this plugin will be used in conjunction with the [lightning
method of deployment][1] where the ember application assets will be served from
S3 and the index.html file will be served from Consul. However, it can be used
to upload any file to a Consul store.

## What is an ember-cli-deploy plugin?

A plugin is an addon that can be executed as a part of the ember-cli-deploy
pipeline. A plugin will implement one or more of the ember-cli-deploy's pipeline
hooks.

For more information on what plugins are and how they work, please refer to the
[Plugin Documentation][2].

## Quick Start
To get up and running quickly, do the following:

- Ensure [ember-cli-deploy-build][4] is installed and configured.

- Install this plugin

```bash
$ ember install ember-cli-deploy-consul-kv
```

- Place the following configuration into `config/deploy.js`

```javascript
ENV['consul-kv-index'] = {
  host: '<your-consul-host>',
  port: <your-consul-port>
}
```

- Run the pipeline

```bash
$ ember deploy production
```

## Installation
Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ember install ember-cli-deploy-consul-kv-index
```

## ember-cli-deploy Hooks Implemented

For detailed information on what plugin hooks are and how they work, please
refer to the [Plugin Documentation][2].

- `setup`
- `configure`
- `upload`
- `activate`

## Configuration Options

For detailed information on how configuration of plugins works, please refer to
the [Plugin Documentation][2].

### host

The Consul host.

*Default:* `'localhost'`

### port

The Consul port.

*Default:* `8500`

### secure

Whether or not to enable HTTPS.

*Default:* `true`

### filePattern

A file matching this pattern will be uploaded to Consul.

*Default:* `'index.html'`

### distDir

The root directory where the file matching `filePattern` will be searched for.
By default, this option will use the `distDir` property of the deployment
context.

*Default:* `context.distDir` if it exists, otherwise `tmp/deploy-dist`

### namespaceToken

The namespace to be used for the Consul key under which the file will be
uploaded to Consul. By default this option will use the `project.name()`
property from the deployment context.

*Default:* `context.project.name() || 'missing-namespace'`

### revisionKey

The unique revision number for the version of the file being uploaded to Consul.
This property will be used in conjunction with the `namespaceToken` to generate
the revision and metadata keys like so:

- `<namespace-token>/revisions/<revision-key>`
- `<namespace-token>/revisions/<revision-key>/metadata`

By default this option will use the `revisionData.revisionKey` property from the
deployment context.

*Default:* `context.revisionData.revisionKey || 'missing-revision-key'`

### revisionKeyToActivate

The unique revision number for the version of the file to be activated. By
default this option will use the `revision` argument passed in from the command
line, accessible by the `commandOptions.revision` property from the deployment
context.

*Default:* `context.commandOptions.revision'`

### recentRevisionsToken

The suffix to be used for the Consul key under which the recent revisions will
be stored. By default this option will be `"recent-revisions"`. This means, the
default recent revisions key will look like so:

`<namespace-token>/recent-revisions`

*Default:* `recent-revisions`

### activeRevisionToken

The suffix to be used for the Consul key under which the active revision will be
stored. By default this option will be `"active-revision"`. This means, the
default active revision key will look like so:

`<namespace-token>/active-revision`

*Default:* `active-revision`

### metadata

A JSON object containing metadata about the current revision, to be stored in
Consul. By default this property will be set to the `revisionData` property on
the context object if it's available. This metatda will be stored in a key as
follows:

`<namespace-token>/revisions/<revision-key>/metadata`

*Default:* `context.revisionData || {}`

### allowOverwrite

A flag to specify whether the revision should be overwritten if it already
exists in Consul.

*Default:* `true`

### maxRevisions

The maximum number of recent revisions to keep in Consul.

*Default:* `10`

### consulClient

The Consul client to be used to upload files to the Consul store. By default
this option will use a new instance of the [Node Consul][3] client. This allows
for injection of a mock client for testing purposes.

*Default:* `return require('consul')(options).kv`

When overriding this property, the returned object must implement the following
functions, and they must return promises:

- `keys`
- `get`
- `set`
- `del`

## Activation

As well as uploading a file to Consul, *ember-cli-deploy-consul-kv-index* has
the ability to mark a revision of a deployed file as `active`. This is most
commonly used in the [lightning method of deployment][1] whereby an index.html
file is pushed to Consul and then served to the user by a web server. The web
server could be configured to return any existing revision of the index.html
file as requested by a query parameter. However, the revision marked as the
currently `active` revision would be returned if no query paramter is present.
For more detailed information on this method of deployment please refer to the
[ember-cli-deploy-lightning-pack README][1].

### How do I activate a revision?

A user can activate a revision by either:

- Passing a command line argument to the `deploy` command:

```bash
$ ember deploy --activate=true
```

- Running the `deploy:activate` command:

```bash
$ ember deploy:activate <revision-key>
```

- Setting the `activateOnDeploy` flag in `deploy.js`

```javascript
ENV.pipeline = {
  activateOnDeploy: true
}
```

### What does activation do?

When *ember-cli-deploy-consul-kv-index* uploads a file to Consul, it uploads it
under the key defined by a combination of the two config properties
`namespaceToken` and `revisionKey`.

So, if the `namespaceToken` was configured to be `my-app` and there had been 3
revisons deployed, then Consul might look something like this:

```bash
$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8500/v1/kv/my-app?keys

["my-app/recent-revisions", "my-app/revisions/9ab2021411f0cbc5ebd5ef8ddcd85cef",
"my-app/revisions/499f5ac793551296aaf7f1ec74b2ca79",
"my-app/revisions/f769d3afb67bd20ccdb083549048c86c"]
```

Activating a revison would add a new entry to Consul pointing to the currently
active revision:

```bash
$ ember deploy:activate f769d3afb67bd20ccdb083549048c86c

$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8500/v1/kv/my-app?keys

["my-app/recent-revisions", "my-app/revisions/9ab2021411f0cbc5ebd5ef8ddcd85cef",
"my-app/revisions/499f5ac793551296aaf7f1ec74b2ca79",
"my-app/revisions/f769d3afb67bd20ccdb083549048c86c", "my-app/active-revision"]

$ curl -X GET http://localhost:8500/v1/kv/my-app/active-revision?raw
f769d3afb67bd20ccdb083549048c86c
```

### When does activation occur?

Activation occurs during the `activate` hook of the pipeline. By default,
activation is turned off and must be explicitly enabled by one of the 3 methods
above.

## Listing Revisions

Another helpful part of the [lightning method of deployment][1] is using
[ember-cli-deploy-display-revisions][8] to quickly review previously deployed
revisions in your Consul instance.

### How do I display the revisions deployed to my Consul instance?

First, install the [ember-cli-deploy-display-revisions][8] plugin:

```
ember install ember-cli-deploy-display-revisions
```

Then use the following command:

```
$ ember deploy:list <environment>

- revision
- =============
- > f769d3afb67bd20ccdb083549048c86c
-   9ab2021411f0cbc5ebd5ef8ddcd85cef
-   499f5ac793551296aaf7f1ec74b2ca79
```
